                <p>
                    From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was <b>scientific adviser to the defense minister</b>, and he later served
                    as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His
                    prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and
                    established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international
                    community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he
                    described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20
                    years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing
                    technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
